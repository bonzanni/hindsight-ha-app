"""Build-time regression check for rerank-contention.patch occupancy accounting.

Runs during `docker build` against the patched LocalSTCrossEncoder (stub model,
no weights loaded). Covers the reviewer-required cases:

  1. A queued job cancelled before its thread starts must release its slot
     (the v1 worker-thread `finally` leaked here — cancellation of a queued
     concurrent future means the fn never runs; the done-callback fires for
     every terminal state including pre-start cancellation).
  2. A running job whose awaiter is cancelled must stay counted until the
     thread actually finishes (threads cannot be cancelled).
  3. A worker exception must release the slot.
  4. The counter must end at zero and never go negative.

Timing: the stub predict sleeps SLEEP_S; ticks are generous multiples to keep
this deterministic on slow builders.
